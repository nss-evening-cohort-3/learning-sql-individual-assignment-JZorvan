## About
This is a series of SQL 'drills' I used to learn and practice SQL statements.  Written in Visual Studio Code querying the [Chinook Database](http://chinookdatabase.codeplex.com/). I am in the process of refining these statements after continuing my SQL education and combining everything into one file for easier reading.
